Submitted by: Luis Ivan Morett Arevalo

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**

* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

The principal challenge I encountered was the "Fatal signal 6" error, which I couldn't find why it happened. I think it occurred after manipulating intents, but if I launched a new emulator instance the app worked as intended, and I couldn't solve the error in the original emulator.

Another challenge I encountered were bugs in the same Android Studio that forced me to restart the program so I could use it normally.
